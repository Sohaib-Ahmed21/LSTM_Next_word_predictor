# LSTM_Next_word_predictor
This code harnesses the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict the next word in a sequence of text. Leveraging the capabilities of LSTM, which are well-suited for processing sequences of data due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies, the model is trained on a dataset prepared within the same code. The dataset likely consists of sequences of words, with each sequence serving as a training instance for the model. Through the training process, the LSTM model learns to understand the underlying patterns and structures within the text data, enabling it to make accurate predictions about the next word based on the context provided by the preceding words.

By employing LSTM, the code facilitates the creation of a robust language model capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant predictions for the next word in a given sequence of text. Through the iterative process of training on the provided dataset, the LSTM model refines its understanding of linguistic patterns, enabling it to make increasingly accurate predictions over time. This implementation not only demonstrates the versatility of LSTM networks in natural language processing tasks but also underscores the significance of effective data preparation in training neural networks for language-related tasks.
